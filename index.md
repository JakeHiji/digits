## Meteor Install and Setup
First, Install Meteor using command "meteor npm install"

Once installed, run the application using command "meteor npm run start"

If the application is up and running, you can now access the site by visiting 
http://localhost:3000/ 
on your current browser

If all of these steps were executed with out error, we can now move onto the user interface

## Accessing the User Interface: 
Starting at the landing page, here we are prompted with the website details

This overview shows the sites features:
Multiple Users, Contact Details, and Timestamped Notes

In the top right hand corner of the landing page, we can log in to access the database.

## Once logged in as a user:
We now have access to pages Add Contact and List Contacts.

If there are no active contacts, List Contacts will not show any contacts, however contacts can be added
by filling in the add contact form with appropriate data.

## Once contacts are added, we can edit
 the current contact to change the first or lastname, description, address, and
image, along with adding notes to a contact by entering a note under the prompt "add a timestamped note"
Here these notes do as it says adding a note and specifying the date in which the note was added.

We can also have access to Add Contact and List Contacts which have the same operations as a user account.

a user or admin account
